*Abstract --* Nowadays, cardiovascular disease is the major cause of premature death in many countries. An efficient way to monitor and treat the disease is extremely necessary for the whole world. ECHelper is trying to provide a mode that makes the monitoring and treatment low-priced and prompt. By getting the electrocardio data, ECHelper will provide the patientâ€™s detail information to a specific doctor in time. So it can efficiently solve the problem about a lack of enough characteristics of cardiovascular disease exactly. With Cloud Computing, some specific electrocardio data will be stored in the Cloud, which help each doctor to obtain a diagnosis precisely. GPS will be used to accurately locate the position of patient in case of emergency.
